# Events sharing and posting website

This application allows users to view and post local events. Currently designed to be used at a smaller scale andd is still a work in progress. More modifications to be made per user suggestions and input. The repo for the server will remain private for now as I work on implementing best security practises to protect user data(even though the app does not require sensitive information from users).
